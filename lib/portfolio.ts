  status: "Public design prototype",
  summary:
    "A clearer record. A practical service plan. Motoryn is an ownership-planning concept for drivers who want to organize maintenance, ask informed questions and coordinate care with independent professionals.",
  problem:
    "A receipt in a drawer. A reminder you dismissed. A recommended service without enough context to compare it. Vehicle care becomes easier to manage when records and next steps live in one understandable place.",
  thesis:
    "Motoryn’s proposed first offer is a maintenance organization brief for a household vehicle. It brings owner-supplied records and manufacturer guidance together, while leaving inspection, diagnosis and repair decisions with qualified technicians.",
  currentState:
    "Explore a fictional ownership timeline that separates documented work, owner recollection and unknown service history. See a workshop handoff and prepare questions from the gaps in your own record. The planning concept does not provide inspections, diagnoses, repair bookings or a vetted service network.",
  founderRole:
    "Automotive venture thesis, brand identity, visual art direction, ownership journey design, service-marketplace concept, and early partner strategy.",
  nextMilestone:
    "Proposed discovery: interview 10 owners and 3 independent shops about records and service handoffs. Trial 5 vehicle briefs with owner permission and professional feedback before building booking or vehicle integrations. Measure record completeness, clarity of the service request and owner understanding. No repair savings, reliability improvement or vetted network is claimed.",
  opportunity:
    "Initial customers: Everyday vehicle owners. Drivers keeping a vehicle for the long term who want a clearer view of records, open questions and upcoming maintenance. Potential collaborators: Qualified providers interested in receiving organized service history and a focused customer request.",

  summary:
    "Stay a little longer. Choose a little better. Experience Elsewhere is a travel-planning concept for people who want a personal, practical journey with room to discover what was never on the list.",
  problem:
    "A hundred saved places do not make a journey. The distance between them, the time on your feet and the moments you actually enjoy matter just as much. Planning should bring those pieces together without filling every hour.",
  thesis:
    "Experience Elsewhere’s proposed first offer is a human-reviewed planning brief for a short, independent trip in one region. It pairs a clear route and realistic pacing with direct booking links that travelers verify and purchase themselves.",
  currentState:
    "Explore an editorial coastal journey and adjust a fictional six-day, two-base pacing study. Choose your rhythm and interests to prepare a first planning note. The photographs are imagined concept scenes, and the sample is not a bookable itinerary. Pilot scope remains in development; travelers verify current details and book directly.",
  founderRole:
    "Travel venture concept, experience curation thesis, editorial positioning, brand and visual storytelling, initial trip-planning journey, and partner-research direction.",
  nextMilestone:
    "Proposed discovery: interview 10 independent travelers and identify a region where specialist knowledge can be validated. Test 5 planning briefs with volunteer travelers and qualified local contributors before offering paid planning. Review pacing, source accuracy and how much of the plan travelers find useful. No bookings, supplier inventory or traveler outcomes are claimed.",
  opportunity:
    "Initial customers: Curious couples & friends. Independent travelers planning a roughly week-long trip who prefer a considered route to an exhaustive checklist. Potential collaborators: Guides and hospitality professionals interested in contributing grounded local knowledge to a planning pilot.",

  summary:

  problem:
    "Professional and social networks optimize discovery and attention, but people still struggle to find collaborators whose skills complement their own or communities where they genuinely belong.",
  thesis:
    "Consent-based profiles combining self-described interests, strengths, goals, values, and working preferences could help people discover more relevant connections, while transparent recommendations and mutual introductions preserve individual agency.",
